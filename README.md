# Football Match Score Prediction: Brasileirão - Série A

This repository shows a data science pipeline to solve an Artificial Intelligence problem.

First of all, this problem was brought by __[Data Science Brigade](https://datasciencebr.com/) pratical test for the Data Scientist Job__. Felipe asked , as a test, to use [Brasileirão Championship open database](https://github.com/openfootball/br-brazil/) from 2003 to 2017, to create a model to predict 2017 game results scores.

The model's target is the __game score result__. This is a multioutput regression problem and I'm going to attack this problem with this approach.

_Note: 2016 date feature was missing. To solve the problem, I repeated 2015 date._
